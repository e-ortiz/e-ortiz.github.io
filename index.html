<img class="project-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-ortiz/e-ortiz.github.io/master/3dmolecule.gif" alt = "PPM_One HPC Performance Enhancing Project"/></a>
  <br><b>PPM_One Revisited:</b><br> PPM_One is used to display 3D Molecules in real time to study.<br>
  Originally, PPM_One was much too slow and inefficient to run and use as a tool to study. With some molecules taking up to 11 hours to run, it was a barely used program that could be a lot more useful if improved.<br>
  My team and I worked deligintely with the chemistry department to bring PPM_One into a functional order.<br>
  My refactoring the code, we were able to kink out any bad software development practices and see a drop from 11 hours to about 5 from that alone.<br>
  But we didn't stop there, by going through the code once again and parallilizing it where we saw fit were were able to use OpenMPand the help of some Nvidia GPUs to drastically improve the speed of the program.<br>
  Succesfully, we can proudly say that that originally large 11 hour molecule has has it's runtime drastically improve to a mere 10 minutes runtime! A great accomplishment.<br>
  Now, PPM_One is being used to help find a cure to HIV.<br>
  I encourage you to read this article on it<a href= "https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/blog/2018/05/19/vip_poster_ppmone" target="_blank">Here!</a>   <br><br>

   <br><b>Rock, Paper, Scissors:</b><br> A project where I created the web application to be used with a back-end database.<br>
   In this game, every action you take writes and reads from the database. <br>
    It was coded entirely using Javascript with the firebase library as a database backend.<br>
    Whenever you enter a lobby and make a gameplay decision it gets pushed to the database and compared there. <br>

<br><b>Estuary Managment:</b><br> This project that was made using Java and Software Engineering principles such as Agile.<br>
 It's a game that was made to help educate people on the day-to-day of managing an estuary and to help bring awareness to the importance of estuaries and their wildlife. <br>

<h3>Project I'm currently working on:</h3>
<b>This website!</b><br> My goal for this website is to code everything on it myself and constantly improve and update it.<br> If something doesn't work feel free to message me about it!<br><br>

<img class="project-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-ortiz/e-ortiz.github.io/master/chatsupport.gif" alt = "Web Chat app for customer service" /></a>
<br><b>Customer Support Chat App:</b><br>
My goal for this chat application is to help improve customer support chat. <br>
By hosting the logs of messages on a database you will be able to continue any customer support you need from your web browser, to your phone, to anywhere it takes.
<br> No need to close the chat pre-emptively, customers should be able to continue their support needs even when on the go.<br>
Warning, it is under construction and is likely not finished. Click on the image above to take a sneak peak!
