<h3>Project I'm currently working on:</h3>
<b>This website!</b><br> My goal for this website is to code everything on it myself and constantly improve and update it.<br> If something doesn't work feel free to message me about it!<br><br>

<img class="project-image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/cQ4TDh7GpaWJtUkW9PGVlt67voZdlIeq1mIHC0rL9nLAkz25EmzlOGGU8B6w0wQ784uR_gqu5tDE_t9K-2J7DeKTr-qDxmom2apnzPuIDXNlsH9_VSq2j69C7nV-S553" alt = "Web Chat app for customer service" />
<br><b>Customer Support Chat App:</b><br>
My goal for this chat application is to help improve customer support chat. <br>
By hosting the logs of messages on a database you will be able to continue any customer support you need from your web browser, to your phone, to anywhere it takes.
<br> No need to close the chat pre-emptively, customers should be able to continue their support needs even when on the go.<br>
Warning, it is under construction and is likely not finished. Click on the image above to take a sneak peak!
